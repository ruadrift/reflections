When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

so a hardware problem would not lose all your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so you don't get suprised by someone else's additions to the code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks will copy someone elses repository to your web repository - used for web server backup
clones will copy a repository to your pc repository - used for pc modification of changes
branches will create variations off the master branch - used for changes without affecting the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can take it with you and then push the changes when you are able to reach github
