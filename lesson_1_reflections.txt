How did viewing a diff between two versoni of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
only shows differences which make it easier to spot changes and therefore mistakes


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

easier to do diffs

git log
git config --global color.ut auto #shows colors in diff
git diff id1 id2

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

makes sense

get log --stat #show time info

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

so you can see how changes are related

get clone

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log tells about changes and diff shows you what the changes are

git checkout #get a previous version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can test previous versions to see where the program went bad

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
the tutorial

git init #in the directory you want to create the .git file
git status #shows which files have changed

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
create the .git file that contains the meta data for the git repository
